FDM
Version 1.0.0
By Axel Rasmussen

FDM is an application explicitly for Windows which attempts to replicate
some of the functionality commonly provided by the "pciutils" and "usbutils"
packages on UNIX-style operating systems.

"FDM" stands for "Fuck Device Manager," because the built-in Windows device
manager only generally shows information about devices /for which a driver
is already installed/, and even then doesn't make it easy to access the
specific model number of the hardware. Often, this functionality is exactly
the opposite of what is desired - it is often most useful to be able to see
devices that /have not been configured correctly/, in order to determine what
drivers are needed for the device(s) to work.

A laundry list of other things that are excessively annoying in either design
or functionality:

	WMI, DMTF, CIM and WQL
	Managed Object Format
	The entire Win32 API, and all of its meaningless typedef's.
		(From the MSDN documentation for "INT":
			"This type is declared in WinDef.h as follows:
			typedef int INT;"
		OH GOD WHY?!)
	The Windows command prompt, and its total lack of such things as:
		- The ability to resize it horizontally.
		- The ability to [easily] copy/paste.
		- The ability to have the up arrow work as expected.

This application's ability to identify devices is based on the data provided
by the following two projects:
